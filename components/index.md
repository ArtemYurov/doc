## Basics

Components in **MoonShine** are the basis for building an interface.  
Many components have already been implemented in the Admin Panel, which can be divided into several groups:
Systems, Decorations and Metrics.

### Systems

Components are used to create the main blocks of the admin panel:
- [Layout](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-system_layout)
- [Flash](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-system_flash)
- [Footer](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-system_footer)
- [Header](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-system_header)
- LayoutBlock, LayoutBuilder, Menu,
- [Profile](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-system_profile)
- [Search](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-system_search)
- [Sidebar](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-system_sidebar)
- [TopBar](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-system_top_bar).

### Decorations

Components are used for visual design of user interface:

- [When](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-decoration_when).

### Metrics

Components are used to create information blocks:
- [DonutChartMetric](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-metric_donut_chart)
- [LineChartMetric](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-metric_line_chart)
- [ValueMetric](https://moonshine-laravel.com/docs/resource/components/components-metric_value).

The **MoonShine** admin panel does not restrict you from using other components, which can be implemented using
[**Livewire**](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/quickstart),
as well as [**Blade**](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade#components) components.
