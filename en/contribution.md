## How can we help?

The community needs active users. You can help in many ways:

- Complement the code
- Front-end development
- Submit bug reports
- Help other users to understand the details

- Promote the project

<a name="lets-use"></a>
## Let's use

- Blade
- TailwindCSS
- AlpineJs

<a name="where-do-we-start"></a>
## Where do we start?

There is an already functional product that is fully operational and testable. Functional doesn't mean great, so our job is to make it better.

<a name="pull-requests"></a>
## Pull requests

You can suggest new features or improvements for **MoonShine**! Errors and bugs - all this can be fixed and sent for revision. I am also glad to have new specialists for open source project development.

<a name="where-to-discuss-the-development"></a>
## Where to discuss the development?

A separate chat in telegram has been created for active participants of the project. If you are ready to take part in the development, then join - [MoonShine](https://t.me/MoonShine_Laravel).

<a name="if-you-find-a-mistake"></a>
## If you find a mistake

1. You have enough experience to offer a solution. I will be extremely glad to have your PR with a description of the error and an option to fix it.

2. If you don't know how to solve the problem - create GitHub issues and we will fix the problem soon.

> [!WARNING]
> It is important that your pr passes all platform tests and has a detailed description, so that it is clear to everyone involved in the development what exactly happened.
