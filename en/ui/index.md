# Basics

To create the *MoonShine* admin panel interface, many *UI components* are used.  
You can use these components to build your templates, custom fields, filters, decorations or pages.  
The use of components speeds up development and allows you to maintain a unified style of the project.

If you plan to use components outside of the admin panel, then you need to add a directive with MoonShine assets to your template.

```php
@moonShineAssets
```
